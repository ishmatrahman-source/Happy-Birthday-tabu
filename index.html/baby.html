  <h1>Happy Birthday, My Love ❤️</h1>

  <div class="message">
    Happy birthday, my baby. Things aren’t going great nowadays, I know, but don’t let anything bring you down, tabuh. I know it’s not the best birthday — but it’s not the worst either. This time, you’ve got me with you, okay? You’re not alone. I’ve always got your back, my love.

    My baby, I really miss you right now, and I wish you were here. Sometimes all I think about is the old days, and how great your birthday would’ve been if things were okay. I know you keep saying you’re going to have a bad day — but whenever you're with me, I promise I’ll do my best to make you feel better, my babyh.

    Amar tabuhh, you’ve been by my side for so long, always putting up with my annoying self — always arguing, always struggling to understand. You’ve taught me so much, and I’m so grateful. My jaan, I love you so much, and I’ve always got you too. I may mess things up or disappoint you, but please don’t be really upset or mad at me. I don’t like seeing you upset, baby.

    I’m sorry if I ever mess up — just let me know if I don’t realize. And forgive me. I never mean anything bad to you. I never mean to hurt you, love.

    I love you so much, babyh. You are my everything. The memories we’ve made over all these months and the past year mean a lot to me. You know, more than 5 minutes of the 7-minute flashback after I die will be about us being together.

    All the late-night talks, from watching K-dramas and movies, FaceTiming, yapping, shitting on others — oh god, if only I could tell you how much I miss all that and how much it meant to me, ahahaaa.

    My little jaan-er tukra tahhh — I love you so much, babyh. I just hope things get better soon. I want to be by your side, always up your ass (literally), hanging around, being the one in your arms forever. I want to be the one marrying you, kissing you all over. Babyh, you are my everything and you forever will be.

    Hugging you makes me soooo happy. You’re so warm and soft — omg, such a babyh, amar jaan. I love you the most, tabuhh. I hope things get better soon. And baby — I’m with you, okay?

    No matter what the situation is, whatever happens, I will always be with you. If anything ever happens and we lose contact, don’t worry babyh. Don’t even worry a bit about me. I’ll be there for you — waiting, okay? It’s you, and only you, babyh. No other option. I mean it, tabuh. I love you so much, jaan.

    Babyh, you’re the best. Thank you so much for everything. I just hope I give you a great life, make you feel like a princess, and fulfill all your wants and needs. I love you so much. I hope one day I hear from you that I was all you ever wished for — that will make me cry in seconds.

    I love you so much, babyh. Happy birthday again, babyh. I love you soooo much. Mwahhhh. ❤️
